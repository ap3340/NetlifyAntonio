My name is Antonio Pano and I am a December 2021 UNC - Chapel Hill graduate who has completed a Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Operations Research with a minor in Cognitive Science.

My intention is to pursue a position utilizing a combination of these skillsets. I am currently working towards increasing my knowledge of data analysis in Tableau as well as polishing existing skillsets in SQL and Excel. I've also completed the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification as well as a BigQuery Google course in order to better understand cloud computing. 

Below I've listed a subset of my projects to allow employers to get a better grasp on my technical abilities.

My name is Antonio Pano and I am currently a student at UNC Chapel Hill working towards completing my Bachelor of Science in Statistics and Analytics with a minor in Cognitive Science.

My intention is to pursue a job utilizing a combination of these skillsets after graduation in December 2021. I am currently working towards increasing my knowledge of program modelling on both Pythong and R through MOOC's and after that, plan on getting familiar with Tableau and R Shiny for enhanced Data Visualization. 

Below I have put together a few projects I have completed to allow employers to get a better grasp on my technical abilities.
